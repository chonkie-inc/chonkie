icon: 'vector-square'
---

The `SemanticChunker` splits text into chunks based on semantic similarity, ensuring that related content stays together in the same chunk. This chunker now includes advanced features like Savitzky-Golay filtering for smoother boundary detection and skip-window merging for connecting related content that may not be consecutive. This chunker is inspired by the work of [Greg Kamradt](https://github.com/gkamradt).

## API Reference
To use the `SemanticChunker` via the API, check out the [API reference documentation](../../api-reference/semantic-chunker).

## Installation

SemanticChunker requires additional dependencies for semantic capabilities. You can install it with:

```bash
pip install "chonkie[semantic]"
```

<Info>For installation instructions, see the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation).</Info>

## Initialization

```python
from chonkie import SemanticChunker

# Basic initialization with default parameters
chunker = SemanticChunker(
    embedding_model="minishlab/potion-base-8M",  # Default model
    threshold=0.8,                               # Similarity threshold (0-1)
    chunk_size=2048,                             # Maximum tokens per chunk
    similarity_window=3,                         # Window for similarity calculation
    skip_window=0                                # Skip-and-merge window (0=disabled)
)

# With skip-and-merge enabled (similar to legacy SDPM behavior)
chunker = SemanticChunker(
    embedding_model="minishlab/potion-base-8M",
    threshold=0.7,
    chunk_size=2048,
    skip_window=1  # Enable merging of similar non-consecutive groups
)
```

## Advanced Features

### Savitzky-Golay Filtering

The SemanticChunker uses Savitzky-Golay filtering for smoother boundary detection in similarity curves. This reduces noise in the semantic similarity signal and provides more stable chunk boundaries.

### Skip-Window Merging

When `skip_window > 0`, the chunker can merge semantically similar groups that are not consecutive. This is useful for:
- Documents with alternating topics
- Content with recurring themes
- Technical documents with distributed related sections

## Supported Embeddings

SemanticChunker supports multiple embedding providers through Chonkie's embedding system. See the [Embeddings Overview](/embeddings/overview) for more information.

## Return Type

SemanticChunker returns `Chunk` objects:

```python
@dataclass
class Chunk:
    text: str
    start_index: int
    end_index: int
    token_count: int
```

## Legacy Versions

<Note>
The original SemanticChunker (pre-v1.2.0) with different parameter names and behavior is available in the legacy module:

```python
from chonkie.legacy import SemanticChunker as LegacySemanticChunker

# Uses old parameter names and behavior
chunker = LegacySemanticChunker(
    mode="window",
    min_sentences=1,
    min_chunk_size=2,
    threshold_step=0.01
)
```

For the SDPM (Semantic Double-Pass Merging) functionality, you can either:
1. Use the new SemanticChunker with `skip_window > 0` (recommended)
2. Use the legacy SDPMChunker (see [SDPM Chunker documentation](./sdpm-chunker))
