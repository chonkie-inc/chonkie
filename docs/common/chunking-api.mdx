**Chonkie's Chunking API** is an enterprise-grade text processing service built on Chonkie OSS.
Get instant access to all of our chunking algorithms, embedding generation, and text refinement.
Avialble through simple REST APIs.

No chunking logic to write, tokenizers to configure, or edge cases to debug.

Just perfect chunks, delivered fast.

## Key Features

## Why Use Hosted Chunking?

Building chunking from scratch means dealing with:

- **Algorithm complexity**: Implementing semantic chunking, code parsing, recursive splitting
- **Tokenizer headaches**: Managing multiple tokenizers, handling edge cases, counting accurately
- **Performance optimization**: Caching, batching, parallelization, memory management
- **Maintenance burden**: Updating dependencies, fixing bugs, handling new file formats

Chonkie Chunking API eliminates all of this. You get:

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="RAG Pipelines" icon="diagram-project">
    Preprocess documents for retrieval augmented generation. Chunk once, embed,
    and store in your vector database for lightning-fast retrieval.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Analysis" icon="file-magnifying-glass">
    Break down large documents for analysis, summarization, or classification.
    Process documents too large for single LLM calls.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Semantic Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Create search indices over documentation, support articles, or knowledge
    bases. Combine with embeddings for powerful semantic search.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code Indexing" icon="brackets-curly">
    Index codebases for AI-powered code search, documentation generation, or
    code review tools. Language-aware chunking preserves context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Processing" icon="file-lines">
    Process blogs, articles, and content at scale. Perfect for content
    recommendation systems or editorial tools.
