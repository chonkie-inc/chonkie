**Chonkie's Chunking API** is an enterprise-grade text processing service built on Chonkie OSS.
Get instant access to all of our chunking algorithms, embedding generation, and text refinement.
Avialble through simple REST APIs.

No chunking logic to write, tokenizers to configure, or edge cases to debug.

Just perfect chunks, delivered fast.

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="All Our Chunkers" icon="scissors">
    Use any of our awesome chunkers to split your data. Each optimized for
    different document types and use cases.
  </Card>

## Why Use Hosted Chunking?

Building chunking from scratch means dealing with:

- **Algorithm complexity**: Implementing semantic chunking, code parsing, recursive splitting
- **Tokenizer headaches**: Managing multiple tokenizers, handling edge cases, counting accurately
- **Performance optimization**: Caching, batching, parallelization, memory management
- **Maintenance burden**: Updating dependencies, fixing bugs, handling new file formats

Chonkie Chunking API eliminates all of this. You get:
