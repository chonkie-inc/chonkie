**Chonkie Labs** is _Context as a Service_, built on Chonkie OSS.
Upload your documents and get instant access to semantic search, AI chat, deep research, and MCP deployments.

## Why Use Chonkie Labs?

Building a production-ready RAG system from scratch means dealing with:

- **Infrastructure complexity**: OCR, vector databases, embeddings services, storage buckets, API servers
- **Chunking challenges**: Choosing the right strategy, optimizing chunk sizes, handling edge cases
- **Integration headaches**: Connecting embeddings, rerankers, LLMs, and vector stores
- **Maintenance burden**: Monitoring, scaling, updating dependencies, handling failures

Chonkie Labs eliminates all of this. You get:
