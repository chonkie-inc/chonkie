description: "ML-based chunking that learns optimal boundaries from data"
---

The Neural Chunker uses machine learning models to predict optimal chunk boundaries. It learns patterns from training data and can adapt to different document types and chunking objectives.

## Authentication

## Examples

```python Python
from chonkie.cloud import NeuralChunker

# Initialize the neural chunker
chunker = NeuralChunker(
    model="chonkie-ai/neural-chunker-v1",
    chunk_size=512,
    threshold=0.6
)

# Chunk text using learned patterns
text = """
The industrial revolution transformed society. Manufacturing moved from
homes to factories. This shift created new economic opportunities.

However, it also brought challenges. Working conditions were often poor.
Child labor was common. These issues eventually led to labor reforms.

"""

chunks = chunker.chunk(text)

for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    print(f"Chunk {i+1}:")
    print(f"  {chunk.text[:70]}...")
    print(f"  Tokens: {chunk.token_count}\n")
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { NeuralChunker } from '@chonkiejs/cloud';

## How Neural Chunking Works

The neural model predicts boundary probabilities for each token position:

1. **Encode** - Convert text to contextualized embeddings
2. **Predict** - Neural model outputs boundary probabilities
3. **Threshold** - Apply confidence threshold to select boundaries
4. **Combine** - Group tokens into chunks based on boundaries
5. **Optimize** - Respect chunk_size constraints while maintaining learned patterns

## Threshold Adjustment

Control chunk granularity with the threshold parameter:

```python
# More, smaller chunks (sensitive to subtle boundaries)
chunker = NeuralChunker(threshold=0.4)

# Fewer, larger chunks (only strong boundaries)
chunker = NeuralChunker(threshold=0.7)

# Balanced (default)
chunker = NeuralChunker(threshold=0.5)
```

## Response Example

```json
[
  {
    "text": "The industrial revolution transformed society. Manufacturing moved from homes to factories. This shift created new economic opportunities.",
    "start_index": 0,
    "end_index": 140,
    "token_count": 28
  },
  {
    "text": "However, it also brought challenges. Working conditions were often poor. Child labor was common. These issues eventually led to labor reforms.",
    "start_index": 142,
    "end_index": 285,
    "token_count": 30
  }
]
```

## Use Cases

- **Adaptive Chunking** - Learn domain-specific chunking patterns
- **Quality-Focused** - When chunk quality matters more than speed
- **Complex Documents** - Handle documents with varied structure
- **Custom Requirements** - Fine-tune models for specific chunking needs

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Start with `threshold=0.5` and adjust based on results. Lower thresholds create more chunks, higher thresholds create fewer.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Neural Chunker learns from patterns, so it works especially well on documents similar to its training data.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Neural chunking is slower than rule-based methods. Use when quality is more important than speed.
</Warning>

<Info>
  The neural model can be fine-tuned on your specific documents for even better results. Contact support@chonkie.ai for custom training.
