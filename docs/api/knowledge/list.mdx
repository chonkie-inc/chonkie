## Filtering and Sorting

Currently, all knowledge bases for your organization are returned. Future versions may include:

- Sorting by name, creation date, or update date
- Filtering by name or description
- Pagination for organizations with many knowledge bases

## Use Cases

- **Dashboard** - Display all knowledge bases in your application
- **Selection** - Let users choose which knowledge base to query
- **Monitoring** - Track knowledge base creation and updates
- **Audit** - Review what knowledge bases exist in your organization

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Cache this list in your application and refresh periodically, rather than fetching on every page load.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Use the `updatedAt` timestamp to detect which knowledge bases have recent changes.
</Tip>

<Info>
  The response is sorted by creation date (newest first) by default.
