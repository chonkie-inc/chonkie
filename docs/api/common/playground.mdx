The Chonkie Playground is an interactive environment where you can test different chunking algorithms on your own text without writing any code.

## Access the Playground

Visit the playground at [labs.chonkie.ai/playground](https://labs.chonkie.ai/playground)

<Info>
  You'll need to sign in to labs.chonkie.ai to access the playground and get
  your API key.

## Available Chunkers

The playground supports all of Chonkie's chunking algorithms:

### Basic Chunkers

- **Token Chunker** - Split text into fixed-size token chunks with configurable overlap
- **Sentence Chunker** - Chunk text by sentence boundaries while respecting token limits
- **Recursive Chunker** - Hierarchically chunk text using multiple delimiters

### Advanced Chunkers

- **Semantic Chunker** - Create semantically coherent chunks using embedding similarity
- **Code Chunker** - Language-aware chunking for source code files
- **Late Chunker** - Contextualized chunking using late interaction mechanisms
- **Neural Chunker** - ML-based chunking that learns optimal boundaries
- **Slumber Chunker** - Specialized chunker for long-form documents

### Specialized Pipeline

- **Kestral Pipeline** - Multi-stage chunking pipeline combining multiple strategies

## How to Use

1. **Select a Chunker** - Choose the chunking algorithm you want to test
2. **Configure Parameters** - Adjust chunk size, overlap, and algorithm-specific settings
3. **Input Text** - Paste or type your text in the input area
4. **Run Chunking** - Click the chunk button to process your text
5. **View Results** - See your text split into chunks with metadata

## Visual Feedback

The playground provides rich visual feedback:

- **Chunk Boundaries** - See exactly where each chunk starts and ends
- **Token Counts** - View the token count for each chunk
- **Overlap Visualization** - See how chunks overlap (when overlap is configured)
- **Metadata** - Access start/end indices and other chunk properties

## Export Results

After chunking, you can:

- Copy chunks as JSON
- Download chunks as a file
- Use the results to inform your integration decisions

## From Playground to Production

Once you've found the right chunking strategy in the playground, you can implement it in your application using:

- **Python SDK** - `pip install chonkie[cloud]`
- **JavaScript SDK** - `npm install @chonkiejs/cloud`
- **Direct API** - Make HTTP requests to api.chonkie.ai

See the [Chunking](/api/chunking/token-chunker) documentation for code examples.

## Tips

<Tip>
  Start with the Token Chunker to understand basic chunking, then experiment
  with advanced chunkers for your specific use case.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Use the playground to test edge cases and understand how different chunkers
  handle special characters, code, and formatting.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Compare multiple chunkers side-by-side to find the best fit for your content
  type and application needs.
