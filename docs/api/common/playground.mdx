The Chonkie Playground is an interactive environment where you can test different chunking algorithms on your own text without writing any code.

## Access the Playground

Visit the playground at [labs.chonkie.ai/playground](https://labs.chonkie.ai/playground)

## How to Use

1. **Select a Chunker** - Choose the chunking algorithm you want to test
2. **Configure Parameters** - Adjust chunk size, overlap, and algorithm-specific settings
3. **Input Text** - Paste or type your text in the input area
4. **Run Chunking** - Click the `Chonk!` button to process your text
5. **View Results** - See your text split into chunks with metadata

## From Playground to Production

Once you've found the right chunking strategy in the playground, you can implement it in your application using:

- **Python SDK** - `pip install chonkie[cloud]`
- **JavaScript SDK** - `npm install @chonkiejs/cloud`
- **Direct API** - Make HTTP requests to api.chonkie.ai
