Chonkie Parse is a custom OCR model built from the ground up to prioritize speed while maintaining high accuracy.

Unlike traditional OCR solutions that trade performance for quality, Parse delivers both.
This makes it ideal for processing large volumes of documents quickly in ingestion systems.

## Key Features

**Speed-Optimized Processing**
Parse is designed for rapid document processing, enabling you to extract text from hundreds of pages in minutes rather than hours.

**High Accuracy**
Parse maintains a high accuracy for text extraction, structure detection, and layout preservation.

**Comprehensive Format Support**
Process PDFs, images, tables, scanned documents, and mixed-format files with consistent quality across all input types.

**Layout Preservation**
Parse intelligently preserves document structure, including paragraphs, tables, lists, headers, and formatting, ensuring extracted text maintains its original context and organization.

**Seamless Integration**
Parse works natively with the Chonkie ecosystem. This gives it a first class integration with our chunkers and knowledge base systems.

## Use Cases

**Document Digitization**
Convert scanned documents, legacy files, and physical archives into searchable, indexed text that can be queried by AI agents.

**Invoice and Receipt Processing**
Extract structured data from invoices, receipts, and financial documents for automated processing and analysis.

**Form Extraction**
Process forms, applications, and structured documents to extract field data and convert physical forms into digital records.

**Research Paper Analysis**
Extract text from academic papers, research documents, and technical publications to build searchable knowledge bases for scientific research.

**Historical Document Preservation**
Digitize historical documents, archives, and manuscripts while preserving their original structure and layout.

**Automated Document Workflows**
Build automated pipelines that ingest documents, extract text, chunk content, and make it available for AI-powered search and question-answering.
