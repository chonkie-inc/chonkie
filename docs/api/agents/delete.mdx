Delete an agent permanently. This removes the agent configuration but does not affect the knowledge base it was using.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Request

#### Path Parameters

<ParamField path="agent_slug" type="string" required>
  The slug of the agent to delete.

</ResponseField>

import requests

agent_slug = "old-agent"
url = f"https://labs.chonkie.ai/api/v1/agents/{agent_slug}"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)
result = response.json()
print(result["message"])
```

```javascript JavaScript

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

</CodeGroup>

{
  "message": "Agent deleted successfully"
}

- Agent configuration
- Agent metadata
- MCP integrations (if any)

**Not deleted:**
- Knowledge base (remains intact)
- Chat history (if stored separately)

<Warning>
  Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. The agent cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

  Invalid or missing API key.
</ResponseField>
