Deep Research is a powerful feature that enables your Chonkie agents to conduct thorough, multi-step research on complex topics and generate comprehensive, well-structured reports.

## How It Works

When you initiate a Deep Research task, your agent:

1. **Analyzes Your Query** - Breaks down your research question into key topics and subtopics that need investigation
2. **Explores Knowledge Base** - Searches through your connected knowledge base to gather relevant information from multiple sources
3. **Synthesizes Findings** - Organizes and connects the information to identify patterns, relationships, and key insights
4. **Generates Report** - Creates a structured, comprehensive report with proper citations and organized sections

This multi-step process ensures thorough coverage of your topic, drawing from all available information in your knowledge base.

## Using Deep Research

Deep Research is available directly in the Chonkie Labs interface:

1. Navigate to your agent in the dashboard
2. Click on the "Deep Research" tab
3. Enter your research query or question
4. The agent will process your request and generate a comprehensive report
5. View, download, or share your research report

## Best Practices

**Write Clear Research Questions**
- Be specific about what you want to know
- Include context about the depth and scope you need
- Example: "What are the security best practices for JWT authentication in Node.js APIs?"

**Connect Relevant Knowledge Bases**
- Ensure your agent has access to a knowledge base with relevant documentation
- The quality of research depends on the information available in your knowledge base
- Upload comprehensive documentation for best results

**Review and Iterate**
- Use research reports as a starting point for deeper investigation
- Ask follow-up questions to explore specific aspects in more detail
- Refine your questions based on initial findings

## Use Cases

**Documentation Analysis**
Generate comprehensive guides by analyzing multiple documentation sources, creating unified references that combine information from various files and resources.

**Technical Research**
Research complex technical topics by gathering information from API documentation, code examples, and technical specifications across your knowledge base.

**Competitive Analysis**
Analyze multiple product documentations or feature sets to create comparison reports and identify trends or gaps in functionality.

**Onboarding Materials**
Create comprehensive onboarding guides by synthesizing information from various internal documentation sources into structured learning paths.

## Report Management

All research reports are saved and accessible in your agent's Deep Research section. You can:

- View past research reports
- Download reports for offline use
- Delete reports you no longer need
- Share reports with team members

Reports are organized chronologically and searchable by query, making it easy to find and reference previous research.
