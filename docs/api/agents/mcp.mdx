Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration enables your Chonkie agents to function as context servers for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible applications. This allows you to seamlessly access your knowledge bases and agent capabilities directly within these tools.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that connects AI applications to external context sources. When you enable MCP for a Chonkie agent, that agent becomes accessible as a context server, providing your knowledge base content and agent capabilities to any MCP-compatible client.

## Benefits of MCP Integration

**Direct Access in Development Tools**
Use your Chonkie knowledge bases directly in Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other IDEs without switching contexts or copying information.

**Real-time Knowledge**
Your agents provide up-to-date information from your knowledge bases, ensuring you always work with the latest documentation and data.

**Consistent Agent Behavior**
The same agent configuration, system prompts, and knowledge base access you've set up in Chonkie Labs works seamlessly in MCP clients.

**Team Collaboration**
Share MCP-enabled agents across your team, ensuring everyone has access to the same knowledge sources and agent capabilities.

## Enabling MCP for Your Agent

MCP integration is managed directly in the Chonkie Labs interface:

1. Navigate to your agent in the dashboard
2. Go to the "MCP" or "Integrations" section
3. Toggle MCP status to "Active"
4. Configure visibility settings (private or public)
5. Copy the MCP server configuration

Once deployed, your agent is available as an MCP server at the provided endpoint.

## Monitoring and Observability

After your MCP server is deployed, an observability dashboard is available at **mcp.chonkie.ai** where you can:

- Monitor MCP server usage and requests
- View connection logs and statistics
- Track which clients are accessing your agent
- Analyze performance metrics
- Troubleshoot connection issues

## Connecting to Claude Desktop

Once MCP is enabled for your agent, you can add it to Claude Desktop:

1. Enable MCP for your agent in Chonkie Labs
2. Copy the MCP configuration provided
3. Add the configuration to your Claude Desktop settings
4. Restart Claude Desktop
5. Your Chonkie agent will appear as an available context source

Your agent's knowledge base and capabilities are now accessible directly in Claude Desktop conversations.

## Security and Access Control

**Private Agents**
By default, MCP-enabled agents are private and require authentication. Only authorized users with valid API keys can access your agent through MCP.

**Public Agents**
You can optionally make agents publicly accessible through MCP for open-source documentation or public knowledge bases.

**Access Monitoring**
The observability dashboard at mcp.chonkie.ai provides detailed logs of all access attempts and usage patterns, helping you maintain security and compliance.

## Use Cases

**Development Workflows**
Connect your technical documentation and internal APIs to development tools, enabling developers to access company knowledge directly in their IDE.

**Documentation Access**
Make product documentation, API references, and internal wikis available in Claude Desktop for quick reference during conversations.

**Support and Training**
Provide support teams with instant access to knowledge bases and documentation through Claude Desktop or other MCP clients.

**Research and Analysis**
Access research databases, technical papers, and analysis reports directly in your AI tools for comprehensive information synthesis.

## Managing MCP Servers

You can enable or disable MCP for any agent at any time through the Chonkie Labs interface. Changes take effect immediately:

- **Activate**: Enable MCP access for an agent
- **Deactivate**: Temporarily disable MCP without removing configuration
- **Remove**: Completely remove MCP integration from an agent

When you deactivate or remove MCP, existing client connections will be terminated, and the agent will no longer be accessible through the MCP protocol.
