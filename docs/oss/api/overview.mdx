## Why Use the API?

- **Language-agnostic** — call from JavaScript, Go, Ruby, or any HTTP client
- **Self-hosted** — your data never leaves your infrastructure
- **Full feature parity** — all Chonkie chunkers and refineries, over HTTP
- **Batch support** — chunk multiple documents in a single request
- **No auth required** — just run it and chunk away
