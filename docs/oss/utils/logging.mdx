By default, Chonkie logs warnings and errors. You can control what gets logged using the `CHONKIE_LOG` environment variable or configure it programmatically.

## Quick Setup

Set the `CHONKIE_LOG` environment variable before importing chonkie:

```bash
export CHONKIE_LOG=debug  # Show everything
export CHONKIE_LOG=info   # Show info, warnings, and errors
export CHONKIE_LOG=warning # Show warnings and errors (default)
export CHONKIE_LOG=error  # Show only errors
export CHONKIE_LOG=off    # Disable all logging
```

## Programmatic Configuration

Configure logging from your Python code:

```python
from chonkie.logger import configure_logging

# Enable debug logging
configure_logging("debug")

# Disable logging completely
configure_logging("off")

# Back to warnings and errors
configure_logging("warning")
```

## Log Levels

- `debug` - Everything (chunker initialization, text processing, chunk counts)
- `info` - High-level operations (chunk creation, file operations)
- `warning` - Potential issues (default)
- `error` - Only errors
- `off` - Silent

## Example Output

```
2025-11-13 13:54:00,432 | WARNING  | chonkie.chunker.base:__init__:32 - Token limit exceeded
2025-11-13 13:54:00,432 | ERROR    | chonkie.handshakes.chroma:write:207 - Failed to write chunks
```

That's it. Logging is simple and stays out of your way.
